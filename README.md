# SOEN 341 - Software Processes


## Project

Buddy Up is an online application designed to improve Students’ learning process by allowing them to find a study buddy for the same course, or to help them book an appointment with a teacher or teacher’s assistant. Students and instructors “enroll” in a course and enter their current, weekly availabilities. The application then finds all of the possible matches with  respective peers or instructors.
